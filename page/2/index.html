    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Lots people (including myself) enjoy the ability for passwords to be saved for them. This has a number of upsides, the main one being the ability to use different passwords for each website without having to remember each individual password.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to do this, the most prevalent being the built-in password saving mechanisms for each web browser. I really, <em>really</em> don’t like these, for a number of reasons. The largest one is that if someone manages to get access to your filesystem (not even necessarily physical access to your computer, just access to your filesystem) they’ll be able to copy over your user data directory (profile, plugins, etc etc) and will be able to start their web browser “as you” on their local machine, putting all of your saved passwords into their hands.<br>Internet Explorer, oddly, is smart enough to force you to enter the windows session password for the original account, but that requires me to start using Internet Explorer, which I really do not want to do for other various reasons.</p>
<p>So, how can we have password storage capabilities to allow us to use unique passwords all over the Internet (and beyond)? The solution: Use a password management software!</p>
<p>Most password management softwares store their passwords in database files that you can either keep on a flash drive, on a network share (if you’re in an environment that has one of these), or in the cloud using a service like SkyDrive, Google Drive, or (my preference) Dropbox.<br>These softwares also require that you supply a ‘master password’ to unlock the database before you can get to all of your passwords, which allows you to store the database wherever you want to.<br>Of course, for added security, you could encrypt the databases themselves using a solution such as TrueCrypt, but I have DropBox set to require authentication before I can access the files, which is good enough for my purposes. Besides, in order to get to get to my passwords, they’d have to decrypt my rather long master password, which would probably take months if not years, and in combination with my regiment of changing passwords every so often it will forever keep the bad guys guessing. ;)</p>
<p>My password management software of choice is KeePass. There’s a couple of reasons for this:</p>
<p>1) First and foremost, it’s free. As a college student sometimes struggling to make ends meet, this is a Very Good Thing(tm).<br>2) It supports multiple forms of encryption, including AES and TwoFish, giving you superior encryption of your databases.<br>3) In addition to (or instead of) supplying a master password, you can supply a file that will be used as a key to open the database. For the extra paranoid, you could encrypt this key file inside of TrueCrypt (which itself will use AES/TwoFish encryption) in order to really stump the evil do’ers.<br>4) In addition to being Free As In Beer (price), it’s also Free As In Speech (open source), and because of this multiple plugins have been made for it in order to extend it’s functionality. We’ll get to one such of those in just a second.<br>5) Because it’s open source, it has been ported to run on just about everything. I have versions running on Windows 7, Windows XP, Arch Linux, and even Android.<br>5) If, for some reason, I can’t seem to think of a suitable password for an application or web site (rare, but it does happen), KeePass has a handy password generator that will randomly concoct a password based on whatever you tell it to do: length requirements, upper case, lower case, special characters, and even high ANSI characters (letters with accents, symbols, etc).</p>
<p>The other really nifty thing about KeePass is that it also comes in a portable version, which installs to a regular old folder in your home directory and (the best part) doesn’t require admin privileges. Because of this, you can just throw KeePass on a flash drive and take it with you wherever you go.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that you can extend KeePass with plugins in order to make it do some really nifty things. I’m a really big fan of one such plugin, KeePassHTTP. This nifty plugin, among other things, allows web browser plugins to access your KeePass database to basically completely supplant your browser’s built-in password saving mechanism. Because of this plugin and a Chrome browser plugin named ChromeIPass, I now have a (mostly) hands-free method of managing all of my online passwords.</p>
<p>Here’s how I did it. These steps are confirmed to work on Windows 7, and I also have this working on Arch Linux, so this should work on relatively any operating system on which KeePass and Chrome (possibly Chromium? untested) can both run, but as with all of these things Your Mileage May Vary.</p>
<p>1) Download KeePassHTTP. It’s hosted in a Git repository, but there should be a direct download available. As of 1/30/2014, that direct download is <a href="https://raw.github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/master/KeePassHttp.plgx" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>, but if that link doesn’t work then just Google for it and you’ll find it.<br>2) Place KeePassHTTP into the root folder that KeePass is installed in.<br>3) Start KeePass.<br>4) Install the ChromeIPass extension for Chrome (search for it in the web store). The KeePass padlock should appear on the right side next to the Chrome menu. (this only applies if you don’t use Chrome’s sign-in feature to sync all of your history and extensions<br>5) Click on that padlock, and ChromeIPass will tell you that it needs to be able to interface with KeePassHTTP. Click the button to allow it to do so.<br>6) At this point, KeePass will pop up telling you that it’s just added something to the database and it wants you to give it a unique name. Go ahead and name it something unique (location and computer name are my go-tos), and click through to confirm.<br>7) Go to a web page that you have a password saved for, like your e-mail, a social networking site, etc. ChromeIPass will automatically fill the username and password fields for you!</p>
<p>Using the above in combination with Dropbox installed on each machine I use (or even just using the Dropbox web client), I can access my password list from anywhere I have an internet connection. It’s one of the most convenient things that I’ve set up in the last few months and, as of right now, it’s an indispensable tool for maintaining my security online and elsewhere.</p>
<p>This was a pretty long blog post. Did it help you? Let me know below in the comment section.</p>

        <p>My laptop is currently running Arch Linux with Cinnamon as a frontend. My printer is an HP OfficeJet F4480 that claimed to have out-of-the-box capabilities with most distributions of Linux.</p>
<p>Originally, I found that to not be true. I tried plugging it in and assuming it would work (silly me, this isn’t Ubuntu!), and of course it didn’t. A few software installs later, I realized that I hadn’t even installed CUPS. D’oh!</p>
<p>So I ran a <strong>pacman -S cups</strong> and Pacman happily installed all of the dependencies for Apple’s old Common Unix Printing System, and then the system itself. That wasn’t enough; according to the fantastic Arch Wiki I also needed the hp-lib package in order to install HP-specific drivers. So I have Pacman do that for me as well, then I try to run the utility and the installer can’t find the PPD .gz file.</p>
<p>A half hour of wild goose chases later, I come across the hp-lib package source designed for Gentoo. A PPD file is a PPD file, no matter what distro you’re running, so I downloaded the tarball, extracted it, and pulled the necessary PPD file from the tarball, sticking it into <em>/usr/share/cups/model</em> obediently as the wiki page told me to.<em>
</em></p>
<p>Still nothing.</p>
<p>At this point I’m kind of irritated, but I take note of the error that the hp-lib TUI tells me - something to the tune of being unable to connect to the server.</p>
<p>My thought: “what are you talking about of course my server is runn… oooohhhhhhh”. Lightbulb hit me. CUPS was installed, but the moron running the server didn’t start the service. Double d’oh!</p>
<p>Ran a <strong>sudo systemctl start cups.service</strong> and re-ran the hp-lib tool. No issues. Printed a test page with no problems. Promptly did a <strong>sudo systemctl enable cups.service</strong> so I don’t have to worry about this again.</p>
<p>BONUS LIFEHACK:</p>
<p>That test page that I printed came out pretty darn crappy looking. The colored portioned all looked good, but the black-and-white parts looked like garbage. I knew for a fact (from being on the Windows side of my laptop) that my cartridge had plenty of ink left, so I went searching on the internet and came across a pretty easy way to un-gunk a printer cartridge.</p>
<p>Step 1: Get water nice and hot in your sink.<br>Step 2: Fill sink up 1/8 of way with hot water.<br>Step 3: Dunk printer cartridge head in the water. Let it sit there for a few minutes.<br>Step 4: Shake the cartridge around under the water until you start to see ink coming out of it.<br>Step 5: Dry cartridge head with lint-free towel and replace in printer. Print test page.<br>Step 6: ???<br>Step 7: Profit!</p>

        <p>I kind of want to go into my home network setup. Nothing too in-depth, but enough to give some of my more technically-inclined readers something to chew on.</p>
<p>The backbone of my current network setup is my pair of ESXi servers. They’re both old Dell desktops that have been repurposed with installs of ESXi version 5.1.</p>
<p>Every good network needs a naming scheme in order to keep track of which machine is which. Some places use geographic location and machine name tags (eg. htn-ad-524-23 for Houghton branch, administrative building, room 524, machine number 23), some use names that are vaguely familiar or follow some sort of theme (I happen to know one particular business up here in the UP uses the Star Trek universe as a source for machine names, and I know another uses Homestar Runner characters). I decided on using character names from the popular Disney movie series The Lion King, mostly arbitrarily (but also because the first machine that I named was my first server, Rafiki, and the naming scheme just kind of stuck).</p>
<p>The first of my ESXi servers, named Mufasa, is a Dell Optiplex 755 with 8GB of RAM and a Core 2 Duo E8400. This machine runs all of my Linux virtual machines, including my SSH bastion host (Timon), my web/DNS server (Pumbaa, who is hosting among other things the blog you’re looking at right now!), my E-mail server (Kovu), my file server (Sarafina), and direct download box (Kiara). All of these servers are running CentOS 6.4 (or 6.5 on some of the newer machines). Mufasa is also going to host a Windows 2008 R2 domain controller for my experimentation with multi-master replication, once I get it set up.</p>
<p>My second ESXi server is named Scar, and he’s a Dell Vostro desktop with 7GB of RAM (yes, 7GB, it was as much DDR2 RAM as I had lying around) and a Core2Quad Q6600. This server is running Windows VMs, including a Windows Server 2k8R2 DC (Shenzi) and the Windows 7 VM that I use for managing both ESXi boxes (Sarabi). I have plans to implement a Windows Server 2k12 R2 box to get myself familiar with its new features, but my classes and work have me busy most of the time.</p>
<p>Oh, and Scar is connected to a Linksys WRT54G running dd-WRT in bridged client mode so I can have him in a physically different location from Mufasa (across the house). Why? Mostly because I could. Also because running a wire to Scar would’ve been very unsightly for my living arrangement (not to mention a tremendous pain in the rear).</p>
<p>Questions about how I have something set up, or want more information? Drop a comment below.</p>

        <p>Hello there! It seems as though you’ve stumbled across my little corner of the internet.</p>
<p>My name is Andrew Siemen. <a href="http://blog.awsiemen.com/?page_id=2" target="_blank" rel="external">My bio</a> can tell you a couple of nifty sentences about me, but to reiterate here, I’m in my final year of studies at Michigan Technological University studying Computer Networking and Systems Administration.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, I’m kind of a huge nerd.</p>
<p>The purpose of this blog is really to write about whatever strikes my fancy. It could be about the latest technological gizmo, it could be about a fun thing that I did with my home network, it could be about something fun that I learned in class, or it could be about completely unrelated things; recipes, rants about Coke vs Pepsi, musically related musings, or any other number of things. This is just my space to express my opinions on things as I see fit.</p>
<p>I hope you stick around to read more!</p>
